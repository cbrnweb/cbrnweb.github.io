      <h4 class="center bolder">What is CBRN?</h4>
      <p class=" justify flow-text" style="font-size:15px;">
        
        CBRN are weaponized or non-weaponized Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear
        materials that can cause great harm and pose significant threats in the hands of terrorists.
        Weaponized materials can be delivered using conventional bombs (e.g., pipe bombs), improved
        explosive materials (e.g., fuel oil-fertilizer mixture) and enhanced blast weapons (e.g., dirty
        bombs). Non-weaponized materials are traditionally referred to as Dangerous Goods (DG) or
        Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) and can include contaminated food, livestock and crops.
      </p>
      <p class="justify"><b>What is a CBRN incident?<br></b>
        An accidental CBRN incident is an event caused by human error or natural or technological
        reasons, such as spills, accidental releases or leakages. These accidental incidents are usually
        referred to as DG or HAZMAT accidents. Outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as SARS, or
        pandemic influenza are examples of naturally occurring biological incidents. <br>
        An intentional CBRN incident includes:<br>
        • criminal acts such as the deliberate dumping or release of hazardous materials to avoid
        regulatory requirements.<br>
        • the malicious, but non-politically motivated poisoning of one or more individuals.<br>
        • terrorist acts (as defined in the Criminal Code of Canada and the Security Offences Act) that
        involve serious violence to persons or property for a political, religious or ideological purpose
        and/or that are a matter of national interest.</p>
        <h4 class="center bolder">CBRN Training & Defence</h4>
        <p class="justify">
          Appropriate training is the key to the right level of preparedness against any disaster, and Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) disasters are no different. The presence of contamination precludes rescue operations to commence soon after the event and it takes a systematic approach to detect and decontaminate the CBRN hazard. Achieving such interventions poses a critical challenge because humans do not possess any inborn, natural sensors with which to recognize these dangers early enough. This requires special training besides the right tools to achieve the objective. CBRN training in India has evolved over the years as a pure military-related concept to a disaster-level response training involving the first responders. The complex nature of CBRN agents requires a methodical and systematic approach to counter the response successfully, and the training for this necessitates adoption of proven modern principles of education management, like training needs analysis, operational research, etc. Simulation as a training and planning offers repeatability, controllability and the possibility for evaluation and is being successfully used in some advanced countries for training responders in the relatively unknown and mysterious domain of CBRN disaster management training. There is also a perceived need to integrate and standardize the curricula to suit the respective first responder. It is strongly felt that with the able support of apex agencies like National Disaster Management Authority and guidance of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, the training effort in CBRN disaster management will get the right impetus to achieve a stature of a modern, progressive and mature endeavour. This will enable India to develop a strong CBRN defence posture very much in line with the country's emerging status globally as a technological power.

      <p class="justify">Deendayal Port's journey began in 1931 with construction of RCC Jetty by Maharao Khengarji. After partition, Deendayal Port's success story has continued and it rise to the No. 1 Port in India in the year 2007-08 and since then retained the position for the 11"' consecutive year. On 31.03.2016, Deendayal Port created history by handling 100 MMT cargos in a year - the first Major Port to achieve the milestone. Kandla, also known as the Deendayal Port Trust (Gujarati: કંડલા) is a seaport in Kutch District of Gujarat state in western India, near the city of Gandhidham. Located on the Gulf of Kutch, it is one of major ports on west coast. Kandla was constructed in the 1950s as the chief seaport serving western India, after the partition of India from Pakistan left the port of Karachi in Pakistan. The Port of Deendayal is located on the Gulf of Kutch on the northwestern coast of India some 256 nautical miles southeast of the Port of Karachi in Pakistan and over 430 nautical miles north-northwest of the Port of Mumbai (Bombay). It is the largest port of India by volume of cargo handled. Kandla history Deendayal Port Trust, India's busiest major port in recent years, is gearing to add substantial cargo handling capacity with private sector participation. The west coast port handled 72,225 million tonnes of cargo in 2008-09, over 11% more than 64,920 million tonnes handled in 2007-08. Even as much of this growth has come from handling of crude oil imports, mainly for Essar Oil's Vadinar refinery in Gujarat, the port is also taking measures to boost non-POL cargo. Last fiscal, POL traffic accounted for 63 per cent of the total cargo handled at Deendayal Port, as against 59% in 2007-08. Although Deendayal Port Trust officials declined to elaborate given the ongoing election code of conduct, it is reliably learnt that the port will soon initiate the process of selecting developers for four clean cargo berths that together aim to handle 8 million tonnes of cargo. The four berths will be supported by a 14 m draft capable of handling 75,000 dwt vessels. The port has already received encouraging response from prospective bidders, for the project that is estimated to cost nearly 5,000 million INR.
